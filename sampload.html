<h1>Sampload helper application</h1>

<p>Sampload is a simple application that looks at the file (or URL)
given in its command-line argument and sends it as a table or FITS image
over SAMP to any suitable applications currently running.
It is mainly intended as a helper application for use with web browsers,
so you can use it as a viewer for VOTables, FITS image files, or CDF tables
that appear in a web page.  This can be used as a poor man's replacement
for a SAMP-capable web page (which could register as a SAMP client
and talk to the SAMP hub itself), but unlike Web SAMP, it will work
with HTTPS pages as well as HTTP.
</p>

<p>Here are some files you might want to load into a SAMP client:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../data/m46-2mass.vot"
                    >m46-2mass.vot</a> (VOTable)</li>
<li><a href="../data/plei_image.fits"
                    >plei_image.fits</a> (FITS image)</li>
<li><a href="../data/ac_h0s_mfi_20070323000005_20070323235949.cdf"
                    >ac_h0s_mfi_20070323000005_20070323235949.cdf</a>
                    (CDF table)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you click on one of them, your browser might ask you what to do with it:
</p>
<div align='center'>
<img src="browser-popup.png" alt="Browser file download action popup window">
</div>
<p>If you choose the <strong>sampload</strong> helper application as above,
you should then see something like:
</p>
<div align='center'>
<img src="sampload.png" alt="SampLoad GUI popup window">
</div>
<p>Hit the <strong>Send</strong> button, and the file should get sent
to the displayed SAMP application.
<strong><em>Note: a hub and a suitable SAMP
client have to be running for this to work.</em></strong>
If e.g. TOPCAT (which contains its own hub) is running, this ought to work
for downloading tables.
</p>

<p>It works equally over HTTP or HTTPS, but it's only good for
file load type actions, it can't mimic the various other options
like bidirectional communication or finer control that a SAMP client
running in the web page could achieve.
</p>


<p>You can install it by downloading one of these files
(easist listed first):
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="sampload"><code>sampload</code></a>:
    self-contained shell script, just do "<code>chmod +x sampload</code>",
    tested on linux and OSX
    </li>
<li><a href="sampload.jar"><code>sampload.jar</code></a>:
    jar file, run using script like
    "<code>java -jar /path/to/sampload.jar $@</code>"
    </li>
<li><a href="http:/www.star.bristol.ac.uk/~mbt/jsamp/jsamp-1.3.6.jar"
                                                    >jsamp-1.3.6.jar</a>:
    JSAMP 1.3.6 library jar file, run using script like
    "<code>java -jar jsamp-1.3.6.jar sampload $@</code>"
    </li>
</ul>
<p>(in the above, <code>$@</code> is shell syntax for the arguments
presented to the script; in e.g. Windows you probably need to do
something else)
