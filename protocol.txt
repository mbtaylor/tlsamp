Summary of TLS Profile protocol
===============================

There are three actors:
  - the Web Application
       (web page served by https and executing in a browser on the local host)
  - the TLS Profile Hub component
       (running as part of the Hub on the local host)
  - the Relay
       (running independently on some external host, possibly the same
       one that served the Web Application)

The following sections describe the required behaviour of each actor.

Web application:
----------------
   Knows location of HTTPS XML-RPC Relay service.

   Makes XML-RPC calls to Relay URL similarly as for Web Profile.
   However, the XML-RPC method names have a different prefix,
   "samp.tlshub." instead of "samp.webhub.", and each call takes
   an additional string argument, callTag, prepended to the argument list.
   This call tag SHOULD be globally unique and unguessable.

   Whenever such a call is made, the web-app additionally requests
   an image (by manipulating the src attribute of an HTML IMG element)
   with the URL:
    
       http://localhost:21013/nudge?relay=relayUrl&callTag=callTag

   Note according to the HTML5 spec, the alt attribute of such
   an IMG element should be present but empty:

      4.7.1.1.17 An image not intended for the user
      ...
      If an img element is being used for purposes other than
      showing an image, e.g. as part of a service to count page views,
      use an empty alt attribute.

   This usage is somewhat contrary to conventional HTTP GET semantics,
   as noted in RFC2616 section 9.1.1:

      9.1.1 Safe Methods
      ...
      In particular, the convention has been established that the
      GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of
      taking an action other than retrieval.

   But such violations are not uncommon.

   URL translation (REC-SAMP-1.3 sec 5.2.6): doesn't work.


Relay:
------
   Runs XML-RPC service at endpoint known to web application.

   samp.tlshub.* XML-RPC calls:
      This XML-RPC API is identical to the samp.webhub.* API,
      with the following exceptions:

         - the method name prefix is "samp.tlshub." not "samp.webhub."

         - every call has an additional string parameter callTag 
           prepended to the parameter list.  This should be a
           globally unique and unguessable string, originated by
           the web application, identifying the call.

         - the map returned by the register() call does not
           contain the samp.url-translator entry.

      Each such call is collected and the callTag recorded.
      If the callTag is identical to that of another call also being
      processed, the relay SHOULD respond with an XML-RPC Fault.

      The call's content is kept until a hub requests it by tag
      (using a samp.tlsfwd.pullCall call), then it is serialized and
      dispensed to that hub.

      Note this request may have been made before the samp.tlshub
      call is actually received.  The submit and collect are however
      expected to be done at similar times, and the relay MAY expire
      a submission or collection request with an XML-RPC Fault response
      indicating timeout if its partner is not received within a short
      interval.

      The requesting hub is expected to be running on the same host as
      the originator of the samp.tlshub call - the relay MAY deny
      the request if it can determine that this is not the case.

      When the corresponding (i.e. matched by callTag) call to
      samp.tlsfwd.receiveResult is received, the result is returned
      (synchronously) as the result of this XML-RPC call.
      A successful result is returned as-is, and an error result is
      returned as an XML-RPC Fault.

      That received result is expected to be running on the same host as
      the originator of the samp.tlshub call - the relay MAY decline
      to forward it if it can determine that this is not the case.

      The samp.tlshub calls are very similar to the samp.webhub calls
      used by the Web Profile, but the relay is not required or
      expected to examine their content beyond noting the callTag
      argument.

   samp.tlsfwd.* XML-RPC calls:
      ping():
         Any non-error response indicates relay is running

      map pullCall(string callTag, string timeoutSec):
         Retrieve a named relayed call.

         The relay must return, when available, a serialization of
         a hub call made to it.  The call will have had an XML-RPC
         methodName with the prefix "samp.tlshub." and its first
         argument will have been callTag.  If no such call has yet
         been received by the relay, it will wait for at least
         timeoutSec seconds for that to happen; if it doesn't
         get such a call by then, it will return an empty map.
         The named call may only be thus retrieved once.
        
         timeoutSec is a SAMP int giving the maximum wait time
         in seconds.

         The return value is a (possibly empty) map representing
         an XML-RPC call from the SAMP Web Profile hub API,
         to be executed by the hub (cf. REC-SAMP-1.3 sec 5.2.5).

         Each map represents a submitted samp.tlshub.* call, with keys:
             samp.methodName
                XML-RPC method name (as received)
             samp.params
                XML-RPC parameter list (as received, including callTag)

         The relay must also treat the samp.tlshub.register call specially:
         it should add a "samp.referer" entry to the first (identity-info)
         parameter, whose value is the content of the "Referer" header
         of the HTTP request from which the original XML-RPC call came
         (see RFC2616 sec 14.36).

      receiveResult(string callTag, map result):
         Receives the result of an XML-RPC hub API call previously
         dispensed by the pullCall method.

         The relay expects to receive exactly one receiveResult call
         for each item it has dispensed using pullCall,
         though it may time out after a long time if none is received.

         The callTag parameter is that from a previously dispensed call.

         The result parameter is a map, with keys:
             samp.value:
                return value of the method, if success
             samp.error:
                text of an error report, if failure
         Exactly one of these keys must be present.

   The relay does not in principle need to be on or near the host
   that served the web application in the first place.
   However, by default browsers will block the cross-origin
   accesses required to use relay services from foreign origins.
   Therefore if a relay service wishes to operate on behalf of
   web applications served from some or all other origins than its own,
   it must implement CORS appropriately.


TLS Profile Hub:
----------------
   Runs HTTP server on port 21013.

   Services requests of the form GET /nudge?param=value&param=value&...

   If it has parameter "relay":
      Treat the relay value as the URL of a TLS profile Relay,
      and the value of the (required) parameter "callTag" as the
      tag of an XML-RPC call considered to have been recently
      passed to the relay.  Ignore any other parameters.
      The synchronous HTTP response is 200 with a small image,
      possibly indicating some activity.
      (If the callTag parameter is missing, the HTTP response is 400).

      Asynchronously invoke pullCall(callTag, ...) on the relay at
      the given relay URL to the named call.  Service that call,
      and return the results to the Relay using the Relay XML-RPC API
      (samp.tlsfwd.receiveResult).

      Servicing the calls should be done in the same way as for the
      Web Profile, except that the information to be displayed
      during user confirmation of registration (REC-SAMP-1.3 sec 5.4.2.2)
      SHOULD include the identity of the hub relay from which the
      registration request was retrieved, as well as the content of
      the samp.referer header included in that serialised call.
 
   If there is no parameter "relay":
      The synchronous HTTP response is 200 with a small image,
      possibly indicating no activity.

   HTTP 200 responses:
      Should have header "Cache-Control: no-cache".
      Content-Type should be image/png or image/gif or image/jpeg.
      Image size should be small, and always the same.

   HTTP nudge requests may be rejected according to host; it is recommended
   that requests from non-localhost should be rejected (see REC-SAMP-1.3
   sec 5.4.2.1).

   Requests to paths other than /nudge should return 404.
