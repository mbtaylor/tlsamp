Implementation feedback from ESAC/GACS:
--------------------------------------

See https://issues.cosmos.esa.int/gaia/browse/C9VALBT-2.

An error "Hostname mismatch: 127.0.0.1 != 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" was
being generated (this was with a self-signed certificate,
presumably hub, server and probably relay on the same machine).
The problem is that the javascript code in the web application
is coming up with a different hostname than the java code
in the hub.

Fixed it in this case by running the hub with
-Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true.

That could be a problem though, given that people may not run
with that option by default (and you don't know what flavour the
browser is going to use anyway).  I can add a special case for
the loopback address ("127.0.0.1" matches "::1").  Otherwise,
I could try to make sure I get the host name rather than
numeric address; I know how to do that in Java, not sure about
JS, but in any case it may not have a name.
